README:

To install the mobile application, extract it, open the folder in Android Studio,
and install it on a smartphone running android OS, the application is designed to run on smartphones with adequate GPS location and camera, with HD display. 

The web application files cant be runned for this reason: they have been specifically coded to work in Predivine, a software of Dolphin Engineering, a Swiss company activein the precision agriculture domain.
Without the entire web application these files cannot run.

The python script requires the following libraries to be installed in the system: PIL, Python-Mysql Connector. To connect to Mysql and the FTP folder the program needs a login txt file called usrdata.txt, with host and passwords, but since these data are not available outside the commercial Predivine product the script cant run.
